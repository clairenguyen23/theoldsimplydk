Well, because “first the worst.”

And I mean, who’s to say Zero is NOT the hero? Zero is always himself. The world needs Zero.

People can hate him when he appears by himself on test exams. But that’s not his fault. He didn’t take your test. He’s simply there to tell you that you need to study better. And hey! Zero on your clinical exams may actually save your life!

I’m sure Zero has blood type O, too. Zero has nothing but only himself to give, wholeheartedly, over and over.

And that is why my first post will be called “Zero the Hero.”
