Interest in computer science and love of arts and crafts.

Web design...well, why not, right?

My name is DK Nguyen and this is where I learn to fail so that I can learn to succeed.

I am currently an undergraduate at UC Irvine as a Computer Science major. There are some skills that the school doesn't provide classes for or, if there are classes, they are reserved for other students in other majors. But that shouldn't stop me from learning something I have an interest in, right? So here I am, trying to learn not just web design as the main skill, but other skills that go unnoticed but make a huge different if one knows them. Vim, GitHub, the Linux command line are just the few things I can list off, but there are many other things I'm learning as I'm developing this website.

Go ahead and come back from time to time to check it all out!
